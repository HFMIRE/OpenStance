## What is OpenStance?

OpenStance is an open-source platform that helps citizens make informed decisions by improving civic transparency.

# Our goal

We aim to make politics more transparent by showing how elected officials vote and act on the issues that shape daily life. Users can view their representatives’ stances and see whether their actions match their promises.

## Why this matters

Voters often lack a clear, central source that shows what their representatives have done in the past. Without context on previous decisions and policies, it’s harder to make informed choices. OpenStance brings that context together, in one place, openly accessible to everyone.
